Decentralized system to store & verify student credentials using blockchain.
A decentralized system for storing and verifying student credentials involves leveraging blockchain technology. In this context, blockchain serves as a distributed and secure ledger that records and verifies transactions across a network of computers. Unlike traditional centralized systems, which rely on a single point of control, a decentralized approach using blockchain distributes the authority and data across a network of nodes.
